# INT TEAM API CHANGELOG
This changelog only contains overviews. For further reading, always consult the current wiki/documentation.
## v5.0.1 (7th Nov 2023)
### IntAPI:
- OnFirstSpawn class is now private. Use **IntAPI.IsFirstSpawn(GameObject gameObject)** instead.
### LimbPlus:
- Added gorse limbs to LimbTypes
- Made FindLimb() & FindLimbComp() more concise, only 1 of these overloads has the actual behaviour
## v5.0.0 (5th Nov 2023)
### General:
- Since this is technically a new release, no changelog will be provided, and thank god because if I had to actually figure out what changed and got added, I would lose my sanity.
