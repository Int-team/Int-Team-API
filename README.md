# Int Team API
## Current Version: v5.0.0
This is an API originally created created by Studio Plus, but now is a part of Int Team since Studio Plus merged into it, open source because stuff like this should be open source.

It is a collection of several cool and useful code snippets that will make modding easier. It was designed to be modular, so it does not consist of one file, but multiple (which is much more convinient to maintain). Those modules are:
- Int API (Base module, contains everything that doesn't fit into any existing or potential module)
- Chemistry Plus 
- Texture Plus
- Creation Plus
- Armor Plus
- Power Plus
- Limb Plus
- Spawnable Asset Plus
